It's refreshing to see folks so passionate about what they do.  They have trained me so well and if you are going to commit to something like this, you better be ready to make a true lifestyle change.  I've changed my ways dramatically and it was hard and I was hesitant at first, but once the weight started melting away, I knew it was the right change for me.  It's hard to break those habits that I've built up over my lifetime, but slowly and surely I'm changing them.</blockquote>

I’m still able to have a few glasses of wine, go to restaurants and eat fruit! It’s easy to stay positive and I can have a good time, indulge a little – but then get back on track when I return. The format makes it easier to keep my head on straight and be smart about things. Friends and even family don’t recognize me at first – making me very excited for the holidays. I am literally a shadow of my old self. I will be 59 on December 4th. I will also be at my lowest weight since I was 30 years old – down 51 pounds!</blockquote>

On February 28th, I woke up and headed to The Gap to buy another pair of jeans. I began shuffling through the stack in front of me and nothing was fitting. I had to go up a size, yet again. I decided I’d had enough. I left my stack of jeans in the dressing room and walked to my car. I downloaded the JumpstartMD website on my smart phone and called the number.</blockquote>

I’m on the maintenance program now and am off the medication and increasing my exercise. I’ve increased my protein, vegetables and fruit intake but no longer desire breads, pasta, heavy carbs or sugar. I really changed how I think about food and enjoy it more now than before. I eat slowly and savor the flavors and sensations of eating. I can't recommend this program enough.</blockquote>

My blood chemistry is "normal" for the first time in decades. Maintenance has its challenges, figuring out a plan that is customized for me has been a bit of struggle. Fortunately Jumpstart set me up with the dietician and a counselor who specializes in people who like to work out (that's me). My goal was to maintain my weight and reduce my body fat and build lean muscle. They help me customize my eating plan to reach those goals and I am now implementing them. I realize that maintaining a healthy weight means learning to navigate the ups and downs and challenges of living in a world where I am bombarded with food messages...externally and internally.</blockquote>

I have dropped three and a half dress sizes in 7 months. It’s exciting when you realize your clothes really don’t fit anymore as they are far too big. Before the program I was borderline hypertensive – now my blood pressure has normalized. Like many others out there I had tried other programs in the past and successfully lost some weight, but never this much, and with all other programs the weight always came back. This is my new lifestyle – forever. Though I wish I had done this years ago, I really had to be ready to achieve this level of success.</blockquote>

I have a history of heart disease and cancer in my family and had reached a point where I registered obese on the scale – the future did not look very bright as far as my health was concerned. This year I joined JumpstartMD and I believe it was the first day of the rest of my life. I have lost 40 pounds so far… But the major bonus is my health – my blood pressure is at an all time low for me.  I feel stronger and on this program, I don’t feel deprived or that I am going without.

Out of despair, I asked my doctor for a recommendation and he suggested JumpstartMD. I have lost 22 pounds in less than 3 months and have made a lifestyle change, thanks to the program.  I am confident that I can maintain this weight loss thanks to the diet being about better choices, not just a gimmick like so many other programs.  I am so happy that I took the plunge, and the cost of the program seems reasonable in light of the excellent results I have gotten.  If you are struggling to lose weight and motivated to do it more permanently as a lifestyle change, then by all means, go to JumpstartMD!</blockquote>
